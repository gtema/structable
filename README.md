Representing data to the user (i.e. in CLI or TUI) usually requires converting
data into vector of vector of strings with the data. Further this data is being
passed to tools like `comfy_table`, `cli-table`or similar. Preparing such data
is a tedious job. This is where StructTable is coming to help.
